Kassasystem

Kassasystem is a simple, console-based cash register system designed to manage products, simulate customer transactions, 
and generate sales receipts. This project was developed to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as encapsulation, 
inheritance, and interfaces, while also working with file handling and exception management in C#.
